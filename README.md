# ethime

ethime is an open source Ethiopic keyboard input method that is used to write Ethiopic characters (for languages Amharic, Tigrinya, ...) based on AutoHotKey. The writing system is largely based on Power Ge'ez (commercial input method).

When the file is opened, the user can start writing rightaway in Ethiopic using the Power Ge'ez way. When Latin characters are needed, the user can switch to and from Latin Keyboard by typing "/\\" (without the quotes). When a switch occurs, a notification on the top left corner shows the current keyboard.
