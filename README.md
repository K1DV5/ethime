# ethime

ethime is an open source Ethiopic keyboard input method that is used to write
Ethiopic characters (for languages Amharic, Tigrinya, ...) based on AutoHotKey.
The writing system is largely similar to Power Ge'ez (commercial input method),
except on the numbers, at which this one is superior.

Writing numbers is extremely easy, you only have to type the number you want
and it will automatically be converted to the proper number. So writing, for
example 345 will produce ፫፻፵፭. To allow either number system to be used in
writing, only the number keys above the alphabet keys are converted. The
numbers on the numpad will produce the normal arabic numbers.

When the file is opened, the user can start writing rightaway in Ethiopic using
the Power Ge'ez way. When Latin characters are needed, the user can switch to
and from Latin Keyboard by typing "/\\" (without the quotes). When a switch
occurs, a notification on the top left corner shows the current keyboard.
